The 26-year-old actor wished his “favourite little angel” a happy birthday with a very appropriate gift. Liam gave Miley a rainbow rock, gold plated ring and it was packaged beautifully too! See the pics here: Liam also made Miley feel special by showering her with flowers, ‘Happy Birthday’ balloons and a cake that looks like her dog Emu.
