Author:quenquen411	AuthorChannelId:{value=UCw5-AAJ9B3_tFeWIqaJLJiw}	Comment:Kind of makes you realize why Beyonc√© shouldn't have won that grammy over Adele, when she's just interpreting other people's art. The poetry is from someone else..... some if not most of the songs are written by someone else. I think singer-songwriters should definitely have the advantage, rather than professional karaoke superstars, like I guess most popular artist are.	PublishAt:2017-03-13T00:59:32.000Z

I think it's amazing how Ingrid took such a specific personal situation and wrote a song about it with lyrics which are so broad metaphorically.

It's shouldn't take  nearly 100 people to produce one track...Why does she need that much help if she's so great of an artist? it's ridiculous overkill.  Beyonce is a product. She is a good vocalist and performer but there's no greatness there. She's still just a contrived piece of pop fluff...like the rest of her peers. She's no Nina Simone that's for fucking sure.

That's why she is credited in the creation of this song, and all her other songs. She doesn't just simply sing tracks that are given to her.¬†She's basically like a director - she uses these songs written by other ppl, and rework them to suit her vision for the project.

I really don't know how people idolize people like her as an artiste it makes me sick. A stupid song like 7/11 took 12 people to make, wtf. Its funny when people said she should have won album of the year the time Beck did when he made an entire album almost entirely by himself. Dickheads like kanye will prasie her though (single ladies was written by The dream if im not mistaken).	PublishAt:2016-06-16T13:39:56.000Z
