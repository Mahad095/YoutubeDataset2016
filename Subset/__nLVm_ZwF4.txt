Author:Daniel Watson	AuthorChannelId:{value=UCRJ0pfmHIchktrBlTLtEJdg}	Comment:God theyre the worst! I always get them when I bulk, no matter how lean a bulk it is. And then it sucks losing them because I know its the last thing to go, and until they do go I look so unprorportional with a 6pack and wide lats and then squishy sides. I feel like they're never gonna leave every time I cut but I can promisd you guys, once youre near the end of your cut, you need to start getting really really strict with the diet for them to come off. If youre genetically inclined for handles, theyre very sensitive.	PublishAt:2017-02-14T23:07:22.000Z

Author:John Hamlin	AuthorChannelId:{value=UCGOAnYq6JDxb1ZXGMnjf8LQ}	Comment:No, you can't gain muscle and lose love handles. What this guy did was bulk up to the point where he was somewhat chubby, then cut the fat out. You can see that he is noticeable less muscular now. Yes, he lost the love handles, but he also lost a lot of muscle. I do not recommend cutting when you have just started working out and do not have much muscle mass. That will make you skinnier than before. If you are a chubby guy with some muscle mass, then his plan suits you. For the skinny guys out there with love handles, you will just have to bear it until you are ready to cut. That's how bulking works.	PublishAt:2016-11-07T16:24:58.000Z
