description:Nick Cannon and Mariah Carey still aren’t divorced because the TV personality is reportedly stalling. A new report claims that Cannon, who filed for divorce from Carey in 2014, has not signed the paperwork that would officially end their marriage. Sources connected to the former couple told TMZ that Carey has been trying to get her estranged husband to sign their divorce papers for almost a year. The outlet claims that the “Real Husbands of Hollywood” star still loves Carey and isn’t ready to let her go yet. Sources also told the outlet that Cannon isn’t okay with her marrying her fiancé, James Packer. Packer and Carey got engaged last year after seven months of dating.
