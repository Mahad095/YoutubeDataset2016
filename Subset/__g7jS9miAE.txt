Todays video is a lyric Prank inspired by Zarabeaute. two weeks ago I ( Joyce) watched a video on Zarabeautes channel, where she pranked her boyfriend, which I thought was so hilarious, so I decided to prank Kenneth using the same song from High school Musical, which is Gotta Go My own Way by  Vanessa Hudgens.  The prank was totally a fail, because Kenneth busted me right away.  anyway we hope you will enjoy the video.  other videos on our channel: if you want to know how we met then go watch our, how did we meet video:   How Did We Meet- Interracial Couple| Interracial relationshiphttps: //www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6Xa0WCaejo  7 Second Challenge- interracial couple- Kenneth and Joyce : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ftBe5Ck2ro  #Q&A Get To Know Us - interracial couple: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkZ6wCWTuuM  Boyfriends thoughts on natural hair - Interracial couple vlogs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ipXO131BI4  Meet the in-laws - interracial relationship: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMKnkfQ_lq0  â˜Ž Contact us:    kennethandjoyce23@gmail.com  Help us get 2K  Follow us on:  Instagram:  @thatsalonetiti @hedevam  snapschat:princesssidibe  songs used:  ladygaga: telephone High school Musical: gotta go my own way Justin Bieber: what do you mean Adele: hello
